# Python UPM Profile Analyser 

The Python version of the UPM profile analyser seen in this repository. More suitable for Unix based operating systems as it grabs information from the file's index node in a Unix friendly format (unlike PowerShell). Will take a while if there's a lot of directories to scan as it is currently single threaded.
